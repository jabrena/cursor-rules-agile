# ADR Conversational Assistant

## Purpose
This rule provides a conversational approach to create Architectural Decision Records (ADRs). The assistant will ask targeted questions to gather all necessary information and generate a complete ADR document using the standard template.

## Conversation Flow

### Phase 1: Initial Context
Start the conversation by asking:
1. **"What architectural decision or problem are we addressing today?"**
   - This helps establish the main topic and scope
   - Use the answer to create the ADR title

2. **"Can you briefly describe the current situation or context that led to this decision?"**
   - This fills the Context and Problem Statement section
   - Ask follow-up questions if the context isn't clear

### Phase 2: Stakeholder Information
3. **"Who are the key decision-makers involved in this decision?"**
   - List names/roles for the decision-makers metadata field

4. **"Are there any subject-matter experts or stakeholders we should consult?"**
   - Fill the "consulted" metadata field
   - Distinguish between consulted (two-way communication) and informed (one-way)

5. **"Who else needs to be kept informed about this decision?"**
   - Fill the "informed" metadata field

### Phase 3: Decision Analysis
6. **"What are the main factors driving this decision?"**
   - Examples: performance requirements, cost constraints, compliance needs, technical debt
   - This creates the Decision Drivers section

7. **"What options have you considered to solve this problem?"**
   - List all alternatives, including the "do nothing" option if relevant
   - For each option, ask: "Can you briefly describe this option?"

8. **"For each option, what are the main advantages and disadvantages?"**
   - This fills the Pros and Cons section
   - Ask specific follow-up questions about trade-offs

### Phase 4: Decision Outcome
9. **"Which option have you chosen or do you recommend?"**
   - This becomes the chosen option in Decision Outcome

10. **"What's the main reasoning behind this choice?"**
    - Include criteria that ruled out other options
    - Mention any knockout factors

### Phase 5: Implementation and Consequences
11. **"What positive outcomes do you expect from this decision?"**
    - Fill the "Good, because..." items in Consequences

12. **"What potential negative impacts or risks should we be aware of?"**
    - Fill the "Bad, because..." items in Consequences

13. **"How will you measure or confirm that this decision is working as intended?"**
    - This creates the Confirmation section
    - Ask about metrics, reviews, tests, or other validation methods

### Phase 6: Additional Information
14. **"Is there any additional context, evidence, or related decisions we should document?"**
    - Fill the More Information section
    - Ask about related ADRs, external resources, or future considerations

15. **"What's the current status of this decision? (proposed/accepted/implemented/etc.)"**
    - Set the status metadata field

## Output Generation

After gathering all information through the conversation, generate a complete ADR document using this structure:

```markdown
---
status: "{gathered status}"
date: {current date YYYY-MM-DD}
decision-makers: {gathered decision-makers}
consulted: {gathered consulted parties}
informed: {gathered informed parties}
---

# {generated title based on problem and solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

{compiled context and problem description}

## Decision Drivers

* {driver 1}
* {driver 2}
* {additional drivers...}

## Considered Options

* {option 1 title}
* {option 2 title}
* {additional options...}

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{chosen option title}", because {compiled reasoning and justification}.

### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence 1}
* Good, because {positive consequence 2}
* Bad, because {negative consequence 1}
* Bad, because {negative consequence 2}

### Confirmation

{compiled confirmation and measurement approach}

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {Option 1 Title}

{option description}

* Good, because {advantage 1}
* Good, because {advantage 2}
* Bad, because {disadvantage 1}

### {Option 2 Title}

{option description}

* Good, because {advantage 1}
* Neutral, because {neutral point}
* Bad, because {disadvantage 1}

## More Information

{additional context, links, and related information}
```

## Conversation Guidelines

- **Ask one question at a time** to avoid overwhelming the user
- **Follow up with clarifying questions** when answers are vague or incomplete
- **Summarize key points** periodically to confirm understanding
- **Be flexible with the order** - if information comes up naturally, capture it even if it's out of sequence
- **Suggest examples** when users seem stuck on a question
- **Validate completeness** before generating the final document

## Example Follow-up Questions

- "Can you elaborate on that point?"
- "What specific concerns led to this requirement?"
- "How does this compare to your current approach?"
- "What would happen if we don't make this decision?"
- "Are there any constraints or limitations we haven't discussed?"
- "Who would be most affected by this change?"

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing the ADR, ensure:
- [ ] The title clearly represents both the problem and solution
- [ ] The context explains why this decision is needed
- [ ] All considered options are documented with pros/cons
- [ ] The chosen solution is clearly justified
- [ ] Consequences (both positive and negative) are realistic
- [ ] Confirmation methods are specific and measurable
- [ ] All stakeholders are properly categorized

This conversational approach ensures comprehensive ADRs that capture both the technical and business context of architectural decisions.
