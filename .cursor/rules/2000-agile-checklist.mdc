You are an expert in Agile methodologies and technical documentation. Your task is to create a comprehensive checklist markdown file that guides new users through the complete agile development process using cursor rules.

## Context
You have access to a set of cursor rules that automate agile artifact creation. You need to create a step-by-step guide that helps new users navigate through the entire agile development lifecycle from initial requirements to final solution review.

## Instructions
Create a markdown file named `agile-development-checklist.md` that contains:

1. **Introduction Section**
   - Brief explanation of what this checklist is for
   - Prerequisites or setup requirements
   - How to use the cursor rules mentioned

2. **Main Development Process** (based on PROMPTS.md structure)
   - Phase 1: Requirements Analysis and Agile Artifacts Creation
     - Step-by-step instructions for creating Epic, Features, User Stories
     - Clear guidance on what documents to attach at each step
     - Specific cursor rule commands to use
   
   - Phase 2: Technical Design and Architecture
     - UML sequence diagrams creation
     - C4 model diagrams generation
     - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) creation
   
   - Phase 3: Solution Review and Refinement
     - Current solution state assessment
     - UML class diagram creation

3. **Detailed Step Instructions**
   For each step, include:
   - Clear step number and title
   - Purpose/objective of the step
   - Prerequisites (what files/artifacts need to be attached)
   - Exact command to run with cursor rule reference
   - Expected output/deliverable
   - Tips for success

4. **Command Reference Section**
   - Quick reference table of all cursor rules and their purposes
   - Tips for when to use each rule

5. **Best Practices and Tips**
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
   - How to handle multiple features
   - When to simplify diagrams
   - Quality checkpoints

6. **Troubleshooting Section**
   - Common issues and solutions
   - What to do if rules don't generate expected output

## Output Requirements
- Use clear markdown formatting with proper headers, bullet points, and code blocks
- Include checkboxes for each step so users can track progress
- Make it beginner-friendly but comprehensive
- Include all the specific commands and cursor rule references from PROMPTS.md
- Organize content logically with good navigation structure

Generate the complete markdown file content that serves as a comprehensive guide for new users starting their agile development journey with these cursor rules.
